pouchdb-memory
=======

PouchDB custom build that only uses an in-memory database.

This build combines the following plugins:

- `pouchdb-adapter-memory`
- `pouchdb-mapreduce`
- `pouchdb-replication`
- `pouchdb-find`

It should be useful for things like quick unit tests. Feel free to add additional plugins on top of it, or just build your own â€“ the source code is tiny!
